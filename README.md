# Creativity
Learning is important! That's what we are doing here. we'd be very happy if you get to learn something new from our code. Correct us if we're wrong, Teach us if we am unfamiliar and Improve us if you can. Contribute to our code so that everyone can learn something.
This is not a software. Use my code if you want but inform me before doing it so.
